# Fixing Overrides

You goal in this activity is to fix overrides that failed to work due to specificity rules.

## Instructions

- Adjust the HTML and/or CSS to:

  - Make all `p` elements bold and dark turquoise.

  - Adjust the styling of the button so that it has a slate gray background with turquoise text.

## Bonus

- Add CSS so that when you hover over the button a black shadow appears, the text turns white, and the background turns dark turquoise.
