# Daily UX Challenge: Progress Bars

In this challenge, you will customize a Bootstrap progress bar.

## Instructions

- The Bootstrap CDN has already been linked in your HTML. Visit [Bootstrap - Progress](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/progress/), copy the source code for an progress bar, and paste it into the body of your HTML.

- Link `style.css` to `progress.html`.

- Visit [Bootstrap - Progress](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/progress/) and take a minute to read through the possible uses of the progress bar component. Brainstorm about situations in which a progress bar can best be used. Consider how much of the customization can be done with Bootstrap classes vs. your own custom CSS.

- Re-design the component by using and/or overriding the Bootstrap CSS. Consider changing background color, margins, paddings, and border, etc.

- Share your design on slack and with others around you.
