# Custom Cards

You will explore and customize bootstrap's card component in this exercise.  Use what you have learned about customizing content with CSS and Bootstrap Utilities.  

## Instructions

 Choose a user, problem, and/or existing aesthetic and customize the styles of the Bootstrap Card Component appropriately. Consider matching the style of your daily challenge.

- Create a sketch/mock-up of three different cards, each card respectively containing:
   
    1. Text only (header and paragraph)
    2. An image and text
    3. Text, an image, and a button

- Style the cards so that on hover they are obviously clickable.  Consider how this affects the button design/customization.

- Build a webpage such that the three cards are placed in Bootstrap's grid and aligned appropriately.  

- Share a gif on slack of the interaction and a sentence or two justifying your style choices.
